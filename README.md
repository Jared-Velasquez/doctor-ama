## Tele-healthcare without bias 

Shalini Rhora, Jared Velasquez, Angela Yang, Jacob Zhi

Dr. AMA allows users to create their own profile that fits with their social identity 
and medical needs while providing anonymity and safeguarding against bias. This is 
accomplished through a customizable avatar option and the freedom to choose the 
questions to answer and share on the health profile checklist that are more aligned 
with users’ medical needs. Additionally, users have the option to choose which physician
they would like to be treated by from Dr. AMA’s diverse and inclusive registry of 
inclusivity-trained medical professionals, easing patients’, especially those belonging 
to minority groups, comfort around physicians and ultimately improving patient-physician 
interactions. Once a physician has been selected, patients may chat and engage with the 
doctor without fear of discrimination.
